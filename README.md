# 2MST_Statistics_in_Motion
A python-based heuristic to analyse the 2 Minute Step Test - A Data Science Project for the M. Sc. Social and Economic Data Science at the University Konstanz


# Motivation
The 2-Minute Step Test (2MST) in particular is a functional fitness test used to assess aerobic endurance. It involves measuring the number of full steps (knee lifts) completed within two minutes, where a full step is defined as raising each knee to a point midway between the right kneecap (patella) and right hip bone (iliac crest). This test is commonly used for older adults to evaluate their fitness level, particularly lower-body strength and endurance, which are critical for maintaining functional independence. This project aims to bridge this gap by offering personalized feedback on test takersâ€™ performance during the 2MST using a python based heuristic.
